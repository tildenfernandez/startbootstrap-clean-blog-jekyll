<p>My name is Tilden Fernandez, I am a student studying Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, in my senior year. This website is designed to be used as a blog for my Wine Lab class. Here, I will upload post documenting my wine tasting, trips to wineries, and more.</p>

<p>This website is designed using the Clean Blog theme for Jekyll. This theme and the work done by Bootstrap LLC and David Miller is released and used under the MIT liscense. I appreciate the open source community and the work they do to create quality code and products that can be used for personal and school project for free.</p>
