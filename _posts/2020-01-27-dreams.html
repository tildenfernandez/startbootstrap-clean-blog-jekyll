<p>This post is simply an initial post to demonstrate how the website will be organized and show what a blog post will look like. Nothing in this post is designed to meet criteria for a grade and I am not trying to recive credit for it in any way.</p>

<p>I plan to update this blog regularly throughout the semester, but will archive it following the end of the Virginia Tech spring semester (May 2022). Any psots on here will simply contain information relevant to class assignments, as well as my own opinions when relevant.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Posts</h2>

<p>I expect to post about wine tasting, food and wine pairings, and cheese and wine pairings. I may sort these posts as some point, but initially they will all be posted similarly and differentiated by subtitles and descriptions within the posts. Each post will include discussion of the wine drank, as well as description of the food as applicable. I will also include photos!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">“Wine is one of the most civilized things in the world and one of the most natural things of the world that has been brought to the greatest perfection, and it offers a greater range for enjoyment and appreciation than, possibly, any other purely sensory thing.  
    -Ernest Hemingway” </blockquote>

<p>Each post will be dated for when I add it to the website, but will contain information for when I drank the wine (or ate the meal) within the post. Any other important or identifying information will be found within each post. Any information included that was not my original work or information will be sourced accordingly at the end of each article. Images included in posts will be my own, images used elsewhere on the site are either my own or public domain.</p>

<p>Ernest Hemingway quote is from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/wine">Goodreads</a>.</p>
